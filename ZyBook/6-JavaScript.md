# JavaScript

## Syntax and variables

- ECMAScript is the standard upon which JavaScript is based. The standard is called ECMAScript, but the implementation is called JavaScript. A web browser's JavaScript interpreter must be continually updated to support newer ECMAScript versions.
- Browsers are free to implement any JavaScript engine. Ex: Chrome uses the V8 JavaScript engine, and Firefox uses SpiderMonkey. Both engines are continually improved to execute JavaScript code more quickly.
- An identifier can be any combination of letters, digits, underscores, or $.
- An identifier may not start with a digit.
- An identifier may not be a reserved word like let, function, or while.
- Although a JavaScript identifier may contain numbers, an identifier name may not begin with a number.
- JavaScript coding conventions use camel case for variable names.

## Arithmetic

- The JavaScript functions `parseInt()` and `parseFloat()` convert strings into numbers.
