# 1.2 IP addresses, domain names, and URLs

## IP Addresses

`198.50.100.7`

- An IP address is usually written as four numbers separated by dots.
- Each number represents 8 bits of the IP address, for a total of 32 bits.
- The smallest possible number in an IP address is 0, and the largest is 255.

The original Internet Protocol, known as **IPv4**, has 32-bit addresses. 32 bits can represent $2^{32}$ or about 4 billion unique addresses, originally believed to be more than enough, but 4 billion is no longer enough. A new version of the Internet Protocol, **IPv6**, uses 128-bit addresses, capable of representing 2128 addresses. The number $2^{128}$ is $3.4 Ã— 10^{38}$ or $340,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000$, which is hopefully enough for quite a while. IPv4 and IPv6 currently co-exist and likely will for a long time.

## Domain names and DNS

- A computer wants to send a packet to cnn.com.
- First, a packet is sent to a DNS server to lookup the IP address for cnn.com.
- The packet contains the destination address. The computer can now communicate with CNN.
