**Office Hours**: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 11 am

## Schedule

- **Lectures**: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 4:10 pm to 5:00 pm
  - Lectures will meet in Lewis Hall, room 304
- **Format**: This class meets in person at the designated time and place, and attendance is strongly encouraged. The lectures will be recorded and posted in D2L's Content but not live streamed. Assignments will be submitted online with the zyBook or D2L, and a midterm exam will take place in class. Groups of three will be formed in the second half of the semester to develop a custom web app designed by the group, and using features (framework, functionality, APIs) agreed upon by the group.

## Why

Where CS 145RA Web Design leaves off, Web Development picks up. We cover programming for the web, using the languages, libraries, and APIs that make rich web applications possible. Development goes beyond posting content for a user to see; web apps allows for user interaction and experiences like data collection and analysis, e-commerce, social media, entertainment, and services to bring real world problem solving online.

## How

We will use a [zyBook](https://www.zybooks.com/) online textbook to study concepts and practice coding for the web. Assignments will be taken from the zyBook, and are auto-graded for instant feedback. Later, you will build a site using a 'LAMP' stack, which will put to use many of the concepts from the zyBook. Finally, you will work in a group of three to create a web application using web Git and web development technologies of your choice, and then present your project to the rest of the class in a live conference.

## Policies

**No cheating** - The work you submit to be graded must be your own. Unless it is expressly stated otherwise, out of class assignments (labs, projects, homework) should be done individually. Assignments can be discussed with other students, TAs, or instructors at a high level (verbally, whiteboard or paper, examples), but sharing and reusing written code or finished answers is prohibited. Exams and quizzes must be done individually with no sharing or discussion of solutions.

**No late assignments** - Assignments submitted after the due date will not receive credit. Please plan accordingly.

**No rescheduling exams** - Please check the syllabus early, and make certain that you will be able to be there at the required time and place. As a professional student, the only conflict with a priority matching a scheduled exam is another scheduled exam in another class.

**Medical emergencies** - If there is a medical emergency, tragedy or sudden hardship, you will need to provide written confirmation in order to have consideration for an exception to any grading schedules.

## To Use Course Server

Use a terminal/command/shell window to log into the server from a command line:

```bash
ssh netID@csci331.cs.montana.edu
```

```bash
chmod 711 ~
```

```bash
mkdir public_html
```

Add an index.html file and other content to the public_html folder to get started.

Reach your web site at <https://csci331.cs.montana.edu/~b62v473/>

> Note that your course site is only visible to users on the MSU-Secure WiFi network. You will also need to be on the network in order to ssh or ftp in. It is advisable to work locally on AMPPS, and then when you are on the MSU network, you can sync with your space on the server.

## Course Outcomes

By the end of this course, students should be be able to:

- Read and write HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP code, and understand the interworking and implementation of those languages on a website.
- Recognize various web frameworks, and explain the differences between them.
- Work effectively in teams with revision control software, and convey that work to a larger group by demonstration, verbal, and written communication.

## Collaboration Policy

All students should read the [MSU Student Conduct Code](http://www2.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/).

When it comes to the assignments, you may:

- Work with the other people on your team if teams are allowed.
- Share ideas with people in other teams.
- Help other teams troubleshoot problems.

You may _**NOT**_:

- Submit code that you or someone on your team did not write and claim it as your own.

Failure to abide by these rules will result in an "F" for the course and being reported to the Dean of Students.

## Grading

> **Note**: The Midterm must be taken at the regularly scheduled time and will not be given early.

- zyBook Readings - 10% (all weighted equally)
- zyBook Labs 25% (all weighted equally)
- Midterm - 10%
- LAMP Project - 12%
- Final Project
  - Site 25%
  - Presentation 5%
  - Written Report 5%
- Peer Evaluations - 8% (all weighted equally)

Grades will be determined after any curving takes place based on your class average as follows:

- 93+: A
- 90+: A-
- 87+: B+
- 83+: B
- 80+: B-
- 77+: C+
- 73+: C
